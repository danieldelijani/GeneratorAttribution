# Machine Learning Research Conducted at Boston University

Developed novel algorithms to attribute and detect images generated using generative AI models. Adapted concepts from adversarial debiasing space, achieving accuracies 6% above baseline methodoligies. Currently the code is not open sourced. If you are researching and are interested in the code, please reach out to me at delijani@bu.edu.
